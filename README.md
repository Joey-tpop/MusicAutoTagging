# Music Description Project
#### Welcome to the music description project! 
#### This project consists of two smaller tasks to make it more managable and build model more efficient
## PipeLine
### 1. Auto Tagging
First, we built a music auto-tagging model in order to generate keywords that describes a music.
We used "MagnaTagATune Dataset" (https://mirg.city.ac.uk/codeapps/the-magnatagatune-dataset) for a train/test dataset

### 2. Description Generation using LangChain & GPT Model
Using the keywords that were generated above, we generate a description (human-like) utilizing the langchain framework.
